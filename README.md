Cluster Analysis in R for Wine Cellar Data

**Overview**

Welcome to the Cluster Analysis in R for Wine Cellar Data project! This repository contains code for a detailed exploration of a wine cellar/store dataset featuring 7,500 high-quality wines from around the world. The dataset encompasses information on regions, types, prices, ratings, and specific characteristics, with the overarching goal of developing an effective pricing strategy.

**Project Objectives**
The primary objectives of this project include investigating the wine dataset, establishing relationships, identifying trends, and suggesting improvements for a more efficient pricing strategy. Analytical efforts are centered around understanding the business, treating data issues (duplicates, missing values, and outliers), and ultimately refining the dataset for exploratory analysis and predictive modeling.

**Analytical Process**

**Data Cleaning:** Initial steps involve treating duplicates, handling missing values, and addressing outliers to ensure a clean and reliable dataset.

**Exploratory Analysis:** Detailed exploratory analysis focuses on key factors like regions, types, price, and rating to understand business dynamics and uncover insights.

**Predictive Modeling:** Predictive objectives aim to forecast wine ratings and prices based on various variable combinations, revealing factors influencing ratings and prices, such as residual sugar level, alcohol content, and wine age.

**Cluster Analysis:** The highlight of the project is the cluster analysis, categorizing wines based on prices, age, residual sugar, and alcohol percentage. Three distinct clusters are identified, each representing unique wine characteristics and market appeal.

**Cluster Insights**

**Cluster 1 (Premium Wines):** Recommendations include an enhanced premium pricing strategy, emphasizing elevated prices for better ratings and brand prestige.

**Cluster 2 (Value-Focused Wines):** A value-focused pricing strategy is suggested, positioning these wines as affordable options with harmonious attributes.

**Cluster 3 (Refinement Opportunity):** A refinement strategy is proposed to enhance low-rated wines and cater to a specific niche audience.
